- Waffenstillstand nach Declaration of Friendship, no CityStateAlly change when Declaration of Friendship -> check dll
- blackmail city state for vote

- MODPACK?!
- Textfarbe Chat (DiploCorner) -> ColorAtlas.xml, insert by hand

- maps for odd numbers of players -> simply Worldsize?

maybe
- Culture From Shrines
- 30HP healed if adjacent to friendly city
- 10% faster growth rate
- 1 production in cities with population 3+
- culture from pastures
- faith from battles within 4 tiles of city
- 1 happiness from citites population 6+
- 30% city ranged combat
- 1 food from camps
- 2 science from city connections
- 15% wonder production
- 1 culture from plantations
- 15% faster border growth
- 1 culture from jungle

some too strong?


VERSCHOBEN BIS NEUE IDEEN ZUR UMSETZUNG:
- PopUp Culture-Ruin (MP) -> Notification
- Dance of the Aurora: Workaround mit 100 Faith. Nicht funktionierend: New FeatureType "Tundra-Forest" (too many difficulties with movement etc.), set YieldNotAdditve=false for Forest (then all other tiles also different yield), new yield "wood" (yield can be inserted but is not added to tiles)
	triggering on pantheon popup is not possible because SerialEventGameMessagePopupProcessed is processed before pantheon is removed from list

VERSCHOBEN BIS BEKANNT OB NÖTIG:
- Japan: Tea Garden/ Bomber/ Fighter?
- Barbs can found cities
- religious warfare -> Inquisitor.xml
- improve ai: less religious spread -> more saving, more ranged units, less wonders (Artificial Unintelligence too slow) -> hopefully already SmartAI

NOTES:
- Community Balance Patch does provide additional API but few documentation/ no help with DoFs

PART OF MODPACK:
- Gibraltar, Reef, and Krakatoa Fixes
- Separate Great People Counters
- UI - Notifications
- Unique Cultural Influence
- Extra Victory Conditions
- Smart AI
